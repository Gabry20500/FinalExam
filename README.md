## Introduction
### Basic game engine
This framework (which for now does not have a name) allows you to create a basic character (with its movement) and also insert a background. Sfml and its functions were used to create it

## How to start
- Enter the [Premake.exe](https://premake.github.io/download/) file inside the folder (If you don't have to click on Premake.exe)

- Click on the directory bar (where you find the path of the folder in which you are) and write [cmd](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/command-prompt-window-in-file-explorer-windows-10/) (If you don't know how to do it, click on CMD and follow the tutorial)

- In the cmd write the following command:
    ```
    premake5 vs(Version of your Visual Studio ex. 2019 or 2022)

    ```

- If you want to try the test level created by me, 
    1. Open the solution, 
    2. Change from **Debug** to **Release**
